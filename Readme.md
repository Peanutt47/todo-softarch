# Todo Application

## Project Overview

This is a **Todo Application** built using **Django** for the backend and **Bootstrap 5** for the frontend. The application allows users to manage their tasks by adding, updating, and deleting todos. It also includes user authentication for secure access.

---

## Framework

- **Backend Framework**: Django (Python)
  - Django is used to handle the backend logic, including user authentication, database interactions.
- **Frontend Framework**: Bootstrap 5
  - Bootstrap 5 is used for styling the application,  a responsive and modern user interface.

### Project Structure
- **forms**: Contains form definitions
- **migrations**: Database migration files generated by Django
- **templates**: HTML templates for rendering views
- **views**: Contains view functions/classes organized into separate files:
  - `auth_views.py`: Authentication-related views (login, signup, logout)
  - `index_views.py`: Views for the index/home page
  - `todo_views.py`: Views for Todo CRUD operations
- **admin.py**: Admin interface configuration
- **apps.py**: App configuration
- **models.py**: Database models (Todo model)
- **tests.py**: Test cases
- **urls.py**: URL routing for the app

### Project-Level Files (todo_project)

- **asgi.py**: ASGI configuration for asynchronous web servers
- **settings.py**: Project settings (database, installed apps, middleware, etc.)
- **urls.py**: Main URL routing configuration
- **wsgi.py**: WSGI configuration for deployment
---

## Database

- **Database Used**: PostgreSQL (via **Neon** cloud database)
  - The database is hosted on Neon, a serverless PostgreSQL platform.
  - **Database Structure**:
    - **User**: Default Django `User` model for authentication.
    - **Todo**: Custom model to store todo items with the following fields:
      - `User` (ForeignKey): Links each todo item to a user.
      - `title` (CharField): The title of the todo item.
      - `description` (TextField): A detailed description of the task.
      - `status` (CharField): The status of the task (`To Do`, `In Progress`, `Done`).
      - `photo` (ImageField): Optional image upload for the task.
      - `created_at` (DateTimeField): Timestamp for when the task was created.
      - `updated_at` (DateTimeField): Timestamp for when the task was last updated.

## Application Deployment

### Prerequisites

1. **Python**: Python 3.8+ is installed.
2. **PostgreSQL**: Set up a PostgreSQL database (or use Neon).
3. **Virtual Environment**: Use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

### Steps to Launch the Application

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Peanutt47/todo-softarch.git
   cd todo_project
    ```
2. **Set Up the Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   # venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
    pip install -r requirement.txt
    ```
   
4. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your database credentials and secret key.
   ```plaintext
    DATABASE_URL='your_neon_database_url'
    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
   ```
   (I already provided the .env in google classroom.)
   
5. **Run Migrations**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
   
6. **Run server**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
   
7. **Access the Application**:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8000/
   ```

## Code Explanation

### Design Decisions

1. **Django Framework**:
   - Django was chosen for its robust features, including built-in authentication, ORM, and scalability.
2. **Bootstrap 5**:
   - Bootstrap 5 was used for styling to a responsive and modern UI without writing extensive custom CSS.
3. **PostgreSQL with Neon**:
   - Neon was selected for its serverless PostgreSQL offering, providing scalability and ease of management.
4. **Cloudinary Integration**:
   - Cloudinary is used for image storage and management, allowing for handling of user-uploaded photos.


### Software Architecture
#### Layered Architecture
- **Model-View-Template (MVT)**:
  - **Models**: Define the database structure (e.g., `Todo` model).
  - **Views**: Handle the business logic and interact with models.
  - **Templates**: Render the frontend using HTML and Bootstrap.

### Key Features

1. **User Authentication**:
   - Users can sign up, log in, and log out securely.
2. **Todo Management**:
   - Add, update, and delete tasks.
   - Tasks are categorized into `To Do`, `In Progress`, and `Done`.
3. **Image Upload**:
   - Users can attach images to their todo items, which are stored in Cloudinary.
